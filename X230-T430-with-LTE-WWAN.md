# LTE/4G Support for X230 and T430 using a Sierra MC7710 WWAN Card

## Why at all?

Early July 2021 the 3G networks in Germany got turned off. 2G is still running and will keep running but with the officially supported WWAN card Ericsson H5321gw this leaves you with EDGE speed üòê

After some research I figured out that the Sierra MC7710 WWAN card that supports LTE/4G is also supported by the X230 and T430, although not offically listed as such. Turned out a bit of a journey to get it working and this document contains all steps needed to get it working yourself.
